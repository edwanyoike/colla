# colla
a platform where devs can log bugs and their solutions for systems within a company domain for future reference and for other devs.

# why

saves time since before going online to search for a solution to your domain specific error, you first check colla to see if a dev in your company has
encountered the same error before and logged it in **colla**

# uses

- spring boot
- thymeleaf
- mongo db
